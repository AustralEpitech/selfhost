# selfhost
This repo is only a list of all the "modules" in the selfhost project, it won't
be regularly updated. If you choose to use it, I suggest that you update every
submodule with:
```console
git submodule update --remote --init --recursive
```
You need to start with nginx as a base, then follow the instructions for each
module.

You can follow the advancement of every submodule of the [project](https://github.com/users/AustralEpitech/projects/2) page.
